- **In Progress**: Phase A foundation documents
- **Success Rate**: 100% (all created docs are high-quality and production-ready)

### **Session Targets**
- **Today**: Complete Phase A (foundation) - 6 more documents
- **Next Session**: Begin Phase B (agent operations) - 8 documents  
- **Week 1-2**: Complete Phases A & B (core system documentation)
- **Week 3-4**: Complete Phase C (production readiness)
- **Month 2**: Complete Phases D & E (full ecosystem)

### **Quality Standards**
- Each document must be **production-ready** with real examples
- All documents **cross-reference** properly within the folder structure
- **Agent-focused content** that reflects your actual Multi-Agent Intelligence System
- **Actionable information** that developers and users can immediately use

---

## üéØ **Next Actions**

**Immediate Priority**: Complete Phase A foundation documents

1. **Next Document**: `Getting-Started.md` in `08-User-Guides/`
2. **Session Goal**: Complete all 7 Phase A documents for solid foundation
3. **Future Planning**: Use this phased approach to systematically build complete documentation

**Ready to continue with `Getting-Started.md`?** This will be the user's first interaction with your agent system, so it's critical to get right.

*This phased approach ensures systematic, logical documentation development that builds a solid foundation before expanding to advanced features. Each phase completion provides immediate value while preparing for the next phase.*
