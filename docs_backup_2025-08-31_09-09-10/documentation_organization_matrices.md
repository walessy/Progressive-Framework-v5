## **QUICK REFERENCE DECISION MATRIX**

**Need to understand system basics?** → Start with `01-System-Folder-Structure.md`

**Setting up the core system?** → Follow `01-Parent-Agent-Architecture.md` → `01-Emergency-Procedures.md`

**Adding new agents?** → Reference `02-Agent-Lifecycle-Management.md`

**Agents not communicating?** → Check `03-Communication-Threading-Architecture.md` → `03-Message-Format-Standards.md`

**Performance issues?** → Review `06-Load-Balancing-Resource-Management.md`

**System failure?** → Execute `01-Emergency-Procedures-Rollback.md`

**New team member onboarding?** → Training progression matrix above + their role's primary documents

**Production deployment?** → Phases 1-4 complete + readiness matrix validated
