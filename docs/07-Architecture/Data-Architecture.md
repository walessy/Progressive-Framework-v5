# Data Architecture - Progressive-Framework-v5

**File Path**: `docs/07-Architecture/Data-Architecture.md`  
**Directory**: `docs/07-Architecture/`  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Version**: 5.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-02  
**Status**: PRODUCTION_READY

## **OVERVIEW**

Comprehensive data architecture for Progressive-Framework-v5, defining data modeling strategies, storage solutions, data flow patterns, consistency models, and data governance for both enterprise core systems and intelligent context agents (MCA, NPA, WPA).

### **Prerequisites (Read First)**
- üìä **[System Architecture Overview](System-Architecture-Overview.md)** - *High-level architecture foundation*
- üîß **[Microservices Architecture](Microservices-Architecture.md)** - *Service boundaries and data ownership*
- üèóÔ∏è **[Infrastructure Overview](../06-Infrastructure/Network-Architecture-Security.md)** - *Infrastructure foundation*

## **DATA ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES**

### **Core Data Principles**
```yaml
Data_Architecture_Principles:
  Data_Ownership:
    principle: "Each service owns its data exclusively"
    benefits:
      - "Clear data responsibility boundaries"
      - "Independent data evolution"
      - "Reduced data coupling"
      - "Improved fault isolation"
    implementation: "Database per service pattern"
    
  Polyglot_Persistence:
    principle: "Use the right database for the right job"
    benefits:
      - "Optimal performance for different data types"
      - "Technology specialization"
      - "Scalability optimization"
      - "Cost optimization"
    approach: "Multiple database technologies"
    
  Data_Locality:
    principle: "Keep related data close to its consumers"
    benefits:
      - "Reduced network latency"
      - "Improved performance"
      - "Better reliability"
      - "Lower costs"
    strategies: "Caching, replication, data partitioning"
    
  Data_Immutability:
    principle: "Treat data as immutable where possible"
    benefits:
      - "Simplified concurrency"
      - "Better audit trails"
      - "Easier debugging"
      - "Improved reliability"
    patterns: "Event sourcing, append-only logs"
    
  Data_Privacy_by_Design:
    principle: "Build privacy considerations into data architecture"
    benefits:
      - "GDPR compliance"
      - "User trust"
      - "Reduced risk"
      - "Better security"
    techniques: "Data minimization, encryption, anonymization"

Agent_Specific_Data_Principles:
  Knowledge_Sovereignty:
    principle: "Each agent controls its knowledge domain"
    benefits:
      - "Specialized knowledge optimization"
      - "Independent learning"
      - "Domain expertise preservation"
    implementation: "Agent-specific knowledge bases"
    
  Shared_Knowledge_Coordination:
    principle: "Enable knowledge sharing while preserving autonomy"
    benefits:
      - "Collective intelligence"
      - "Reduced knowledge duplication"
      - "Improved coordination"
    patterns: "Knowledge federation, semantic interoperability"
    
  Learning_Data_Continuity:
    principle: "Preserve learning across agent lifecycles"
    benefits:
      - "Continuous improvement"
      - "Knowledge preservation"
      - "Performance consistency"
    techniques: "Model versioning, knowledge snapshots"
