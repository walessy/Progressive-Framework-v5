## **AGENT RETIREMENT PROCESS**

### **Retirement Triggers and Decision Framework**
```yaml
Retirement_Decision_Framework:
  Performance_Based_Retirement:
    Critical_Performance_Failure:
      - Consistently poor performance despite multiple evolution attempts
      - Unable to meet minimum SLA requirements for 30+ days
      - Critical failures causing system-wide impact
      - Security vulnerabilities that cannot be patched
      
    Resource_Inefficiency:
      - Resource consumption exceeding value provided by >200%
      - Cost per task completion above acceptable thresholds
      - Inability to optimize resource usage after evolution attempts
      - Better alternatives available with significantly lower resource costs
    
  Strategic_Retirement:
    Business_Alignment:
      - Functionality no longer aligned with business requirements
      - User needs have evolved beyond agent capabilities
      - Strategic shift making agent obsolete
      - Consolidation opportunities with other agents
      
    System_Optimization:
      - System architecture simplification initiatives
      - Redundant functionality consolidation
      - Technology stack modernization
      - Performance optimization through agent reduction
    
  Technical_Retirement:
    Technology_Obsolescence:
      - Underlying technology reaching end of life
      - Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
      - Incompatibility with system upgrades
      - Maintenance costs exceeding operational value
      
    Integration_Issues:
      - Cannot integrate with newer system components
      - Communication protocol incompatibilities
      - Data format or schema incompatibilities
      - Performance bottlenecks in system integration
