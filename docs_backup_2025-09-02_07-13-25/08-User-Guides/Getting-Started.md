### How It Works
```
Your Request ‚Üí Master Control Agent ‚Üí Intelligent Analysis ‚Üí Optimal Agent ‚Üí Response
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                      ‚Üì                    ‚Üì           ‚Üì
"meal plan"    Keyword        nutrition: 0.85           Nutrition      Personalized
"for muscle    Analysis +     fitness: 0.40     ‚Üí      Planning   ‚Üí   meal plan +
 building"     Domain         budget: 0.10             Agent (NPA)    collaboration
               Scoring                                                 suggestion
```

### The Agent Ecosystem
- **Master Control Agent (MCA)**: The orchestrator that analyzes your requests and routes them intelligently
- **Nutrition Planning Agent (NPA)**: Specialized in meal planning, nutrition analysis, and dietary recommendations
- **Workout Planning Agent (WPA)**: Expert in fitness routines, exercise programming, and training optimization
- **Budget Management Agent (BMA)**: *(Coming Soon)* Cost optimization and financial planning integration

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Method 1: Simple Chat Interface
**Endpoint**: `POST /chat`

```bash
# Basic request - let MCA route intelligently
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "I need a muscle building workout plan"
  }'
```

**What happens:**
1. MCA analyzes your message: "muscle building workout plan"
2. Keyword analysis scores domains: fitness (0.95), nutrition (0.20), budget (0.05)
3. Routes to **Workout Planning Agent (WPA)**
4. Returns specialized workout plan + collaboration suggestions

### Method 2: Direct Agent Communication
**Endpoint**: `POST /chat/:agentType`

```bash
# Direct communication with specific agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat/npa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Create a high protein meal plan"
  }'
```

**When to use direct communication:**
- You know exactly which agent you need
- Building automated integrations
- Testing specific agent capabilities

## Understanding Agent Routing

### How MCA Selects Agents
```javascript
// Routing Intelligence Process
1. Message Analysis
   ‚Üì
2. Keyword Extraction ‚Üí ["meal", "plan", "workout", "routine"]
   ‚Üì  
3. Domain Scoring ‚Üí {nutrition: 0.70, fitness: 0.65, budget: 0.15}
   ‚Üì
4. Agent Selection ‚Üí Primary: NPA, Collaboration: WPA
   ‚Üì
5. Confidence Check ‚Üí 87% confidence (high)
   ‚Üì
6. Route Request ‚Üí Send to Nutrition Planning Agent
   ‚Üì
7. Monitor Performance ‚Üí Track response time and success
```

### Routing Examples
| Your Message | MCA Analysis | Selected Agent | Reasoning |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| "build muscle strength training" | fitness: 0.95 | **WPA** | Clear fitness domain |
| "proteins for muscle building" | fitness: 0.60, nutrition: 0.55 | **WPA** | Smart prioritization |
| "meal plan workout routine" | nutrition: 0.70, fitness: 0.65 | **NPA** + WPA collab | Multi-domain request |
| "nutrition tip" | nutrition: 0.90 | **NPA** | Clear nutrition domain |
| "cheap protein sources" | nutrition: 0.60, budget: 0.45 | **NPA** + BMA collab | Budget-aware nutrition |

### When Agents Collaborate
- **Cross-Domain Requests**: "meal plan and workout routine for weight loss"
- **Budget Considerations**: "affordable nutrition for muscle building"  
- **Comprehensive Planning**: "complete health and fitness transformation"
- **Follow-up Suggestions**: Agents suggest complementary services

  'X-Client-Version': '1.0.0'
};
```

### Basic Integration Pattern
```javascript
// JavaScript/Node.js Integration
async function askAgent(message, context = {}) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/chat', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: message,
        context: context
      })
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    
    if (result.success) {
      console.log(`Routed to: ${result.agent}`);
      console.log(`Response: ${JSON.stringify(result.response, null, 2)}`);
      
      // Handle collaboration suggestions
      if (result.collaboration) {
        console.log(`Suggestion: ${result.collaboration.suggestion}`);
      }
      
      return result;
    } else {
      throw new Error(result.error.message);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Agent request failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Usage examples
await askAgent("I need a workout plan for muscle building");
await askAgent("Create a meal plan", { 
  dietary_restrictions: ["vegetarian"],
  target_calories: 2200 
});
```

### Python Integration

import requests
import json

class AgentClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url="http://localhost:3000"):
        self.base_url = base_url
    
    def chat(self, message, context=None):
        """Send message to agent system via MCA routing"""
        payload = {
            "message": message,
            "context": context or {}
        }
        
        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.base_url}/chat",
            json=payload,
            headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
        )
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            result = response.json()
            
            if result["success"]:
                print(f"‚úÖ Routed to: {result['agent']}")
                print(f"üìä Confidence: {result['routing_analysis']['confidence']:.1%}")

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ‚ùå **"Connection Refused" Error**
```bash
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3000
```
**Solution**: Ensure the agent system is running
```bash
cd C:\Projects\Progressive-Framework-v5
node src/main.js
# Or your specific startup command
```

#### ‚ùå **"Agent Not Available" Response**  
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "AGENT_UNAVAILABLE",
    "message": "Selected agent is currently unavailable"
  }
}
```
**Solution**: Check agent status and try again
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/agents
curl http://localhost:3000/system/status
```

#### ‚ùå **Poor Routing Decisions**
If MCA consistently routes to wrong agents:

1. **Check your message clarity**:
   ```bash
   ‚ùå "help me" (too vague)
   ‚úÖ "create a workout plan" (clear domain)
   ```

2. **Add context for better routing**:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "I need help with planning",
     "context": {
       "domain_hint": "fitness",
       "user_goal": "muscle building"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Use direct agent communication**:
   ```bash
   POST /chat/wpa  # Direct to Workout Planning Agent
   POST /chat/npa  # Direct to Nutrition Planning Agent
   ```

### Getting Help

#### System Status Check
```bash
# Check overall system health
curl http://localhost:3000/system/status

# Check MCA specific metrics
curl http://localhost:3000/mca/status

# List available agents
curl http://localhost:3000/agents
```

#### Manual System Optimization
```bash
# Trigger manual optimization (if system seems sluggish)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mca/optimize
```

#### Common Request Patterns
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good request patterns
"Create a vegetarian meal plan for 2000 calories"
"45-minute strength training workout for beginners"  
"Budget-friendly protein sources for muscle building"
"Weekly meal prep plan with high protein"

# ‚ùå Avoid vague requests
"help me"
"what should I do"
"give me advice"
"tell me something"
```
